ML engineer working on JAX/XLA at Google. Previously built high-performance inference systems at VMware (contributing to vLLM) and RL-driven AI agent optimization at Connectly.

My personal research focuses on embodied AI and robotics. Currently exploring robotics foundation models, reproducing and fine-tuning the latest VLA and RL research in simulation (MuJoCo/MJX), and running small-scale real robot experiments. 

Passionate about learning systems that scale, from GPU kernels to autonomous robots.
