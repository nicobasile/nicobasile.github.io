title: Enhancing Long-Horizon Embodied Agents in Open-World 3D Environments
categories: [embodied-ai, agents]

Open‑world 3D environments like Minecraft present a uniquely challenging setting for embodied agents: sparse rewards, enormous action spaces, and tasks that require extended temporal reasoning. NVIDIA’s Voyager laid the foundation for autonomous curriculum learning and tool‑use, but retained limitations in long‑horizon multi‑stage objectives.

My goal was to push these boundaries further—

* enabling agents to remember *what they’ve done*,
* reason about *what must happen next*, and
* plan *several layers ahead*.

This project focuses on equipping an embodied agent with **structured memory**, **hierarchical planning**, and **improved tool‑use capabilities**, ultimately improving success on complex multi‑stage tasks by **>40%**.
